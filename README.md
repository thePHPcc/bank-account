# From Events to Insights
## Sebastian Bergmann

> In modern architectures, loosely coupled subsystems collaborate via events rather than giving each other direct instructions. This is referred to as event sourcing if the entire state of an application can be reconstructed from these events.
> 
> I teach you proven strategies and best practices for testing event-based software. Using PHP and PHPUnit as examples, you will see how tests can be implemented to generate visual documentation of event-based software through their execution.

The example application developed in this repository is used, for example ;-), by [Sebastian Bergmann](https://phpunit.expert/?ref=github) in his "[From Events to Insights](https://phpunit.expert/presentations/from-events-to-insights.html?ref=github)" presentation.
